# Sanskrit-Non-Translatable-Terms
Inspired from Rajiv Malhotra Ji's book: The Battle for Sanskrit, this is a small contribution towards making a list of terms/concepts in Sanskrit/Indian Culture which are non-translatable in English/Western Culture.

### How to Navigate
`List of Sanskrit Terms Devnagari`
  List of terms whose details have been added. The list is in Devnagari.

`List of Sanskrit Terms ITRANS`
  List of terms whose details have been added. The list is in ITRANS.

`/SanskritTerms`
  Folder containing individual Sanskrit terms with all details and comparisons. The files are markdown files for direct viewing.
 
`/jsonSanskrit`
  Folder containing data of individual Sanskrit terms in json format.

### How to Contribute
There are 3 ways to contribute:
1) Find Sanskrit terms that have wrong translations in English and add them in the file [ToAdd](https://github.com/shailbala/Sanskrit-Non-Translatable-Terms/blob/master/ToAdd).
The format should be `SanskritTerm vs EnglishTerm`. Follow alphabetical order.

2) Pick any term from [ToAdd](https://github.com/shailbala/Sanskrit-Non-Translatable-Terms/blob/master/ToAdd) and make a new entry for it. For every Sanskrit word, two files should be created. One in [/jsonSanskrit](https://github.com/shailbala/Sanskrit-Non-Translatable-Terms/tree/master/jsonSanskrit) and other in [/SanskritTerms](https://github.com/shailbala/Sanskrit-Non-Translatable-Terms/tree/master/SanskritTerms).

* The folder /SanskritTerms contains the data in human readable form and /jsonSanskrit contains data in json format. You need to update atleast /SanskritTerms.
* The actual content for each word should not vary.

3) Add references, links, books, or other references for already added words.
