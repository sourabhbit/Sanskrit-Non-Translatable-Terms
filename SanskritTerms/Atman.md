### Comparison
|Atman	|Soul	|
|----|----|
|In dharmic tradition, the true nature of self or Atman is sat-chit-ananda.|In Christianity, all humans are born as sinners due to original sin by adam & eve. Hence the true self or Soul is sinful.|
|The true nature of Atman can be realised with sadhana or adhyatma vidya.|Only through Jesus can the Soul attain salvation.|
|Atman is present in plants and animals. Hence nature is as sacred as the self.|Soul is NOT PRESENT in plants and animal. In Bible, GOD gave mankind dominion over plants and animals.|
|Atman reincarnates. Hence the body is cremated once atman has departed.|Soul DOES NOT reincarnate. Hence in Christianity you get only one body that must be preserved till the 'end of time'.|
