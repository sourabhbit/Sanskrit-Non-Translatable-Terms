|----|----|
|Sanskrit word 'Murti' means real, awakened and expressive of divine spirit.|In Christianity, If an object is revered/respected but not worshipped is termed as 'ICON' but if elevated as divine status it is called 'IDOL'. In Orthodox Christianity, icons/images are KISSED, TOUCHED, REVERED, RESPECTED but 'technically' not worshipped. What Christians revere are ICONS while images, murtis, devotional objects were termed IDOLS and not ICONS.|
|Prana-Pratishtha' pooja is the ritual of infusing the Murtis with prana or divine energy. Its only after prana-pratishtha pooja is offered to Murtis.|No such thing happens with idols.|
|Visarjan is the ritual of throwing the Murti in holy water to encourage detachment from the Murti i.e., encourages non-attachment to Murtis.|No such thing happens with idols.|
|As per Aurobindo, it is not the stone but the divine presence/energy in the Murti to which the prayer is offered.|--|
